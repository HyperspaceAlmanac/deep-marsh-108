A gaming blog where I will be working towards creating a set of tools for creating more robuts martial arts video games. Inspired by the amazing choreography from the 1998 tv adapatation of Water Margins, I want to create a more complex simulation of the human body (focusing on the muscles) and use it to teach a DNN martial arts. I want the simulation to be customizable and extendable so that it can potentially also be used to simulate some magic system or even Shonen battle manga / anime power system.
